# `website`

My personal site website written in Next.js using TypeScript

## Thanks

â€¢ Ana Arsonist, for [open sourcing her website!](https://github.com/AnaArsonist/anahoward.me)

## Usage

If you'd like to use this as a template for your own personal site, please make sure you leave my name on the home page and in the readme of the repository! You will have to fill out some `.env` variables too. You can view the `src/server/env.ts` file to see what is needed.
